**Inseason analysis of chum salmon (*Oncorhynchus* *keta*) bycatch from the shoreside
  sector of the Bering Sea Aleutian Islands walleye pollock (*Gadus* *chalcogrammus*)
  trawl fishery**

In 2024, a project was initiated by Bristol Bay Science Research Institute (BBSRI) with 
collaboration from NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science Center's Genetics Program to sample
and analyze the chum salmon bycatch from the shoreside sector of the midwater pollock trawl fishery fleet 
in order to obtain weekly estimates of genetic stock composition. 

This repository containes code that is used to perform weekly analyses. A single control file 
'InseasonChumGSI_CtrlFile.R' is used to define the statistical week being evaluated, and run 
both GSI analysis, code contained in 'SW_GSI.R', and generate the weekly report in 'InseasonGSIAnalysis.Rmd'.
